# SmartCalc_v2.0-1
As part of the SmartCalc v1.0 project, an expanded version of the calculator was developed in the C++ programming language. This application is based on the principles of object-oriented programming and includes all the basic functions of a regular calculator. The main development pattern is MVC (Model-View-Controller).
